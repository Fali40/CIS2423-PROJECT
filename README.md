with a focus on the way they sleep and their routine. It tells us about their gender, age, and what they do for living. 
It also tells us about the number of hours they sleep and how well they sleep. We are able to view how much they exercise, 
how stressed out they are, and how many steps they get per day. It also includes their BMI category, their blood pressure, 
and heart rate. Most of all, it tells us if they have a sleep disorder or not. By taking all these Information into account, 
we can determine how our health and lifestyle affect our sleep and even try to forecast whether someone have trouble in sleeping.
